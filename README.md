How many times have you told yourself, “I need to spend more time studying”? How often have you accidentally spent hours playing video games when you should have been doing chores?

With the new time management app, “It’s Time To Start!”, you can track how long you spend doing tasks throughout your day!

To start, you can set goals for how long you want to spend doing a task under the set goals menu. Here, you can enter a task and the time you want to spend working on it. 

For activities that you want to spend less of your time on, you can set time limits under the set limits menu. Similarly to the goal setter, you can enter a task and the maximum amount of time you want to spend doing it.

On the main menu of the program, you can enter a task and then click the “Start Timer” button when you are ready to start the task. The elapsed time can be seen on this screen. If you do not want to see the time, you can check “Don’t show timer” and it will disappear. If you want to take a break from working on the task, you can click the pause button to pause the timer. You can then press the “Resume” button to start the timer again. When you are finished with the task, you can click the “Stop Timer” button. The name of the task you completed, the time you started it, the time you ended it, and the total time spent working on it will then be displayed below the timer. You can then enter and time a new task, and each one will be displayed on this screen when you complete it.

To see a report of the time you have spent per task, you can go to the “Task Time Bar Graph” menu. This page displays a bar graph, showing all of the activities you have completed and the time, in minutes, that you have spent working on them.

Although this has not been implemented yet, there is an “Analyze Goals” sub-menu, which would show a progress bar for each goal you set in the “Set Goals” sub-menu. As you spend time working on these goals, the bar will fill up until you hit your goal.

With, “It’s Time To Start!”, you can have time to achieve all of your goals, whether they are academic or personal.
